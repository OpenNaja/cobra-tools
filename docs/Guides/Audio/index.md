# Audio

## Wwise Format
Useful reading on the format:

- [wwiser Documentation](https://github.com/bnnm/wwiser/blob/master/doc/WWISER.md)
- [Audiokinetic Wwise Tutorials](https://www.audiokinetic.com/courses/wwise101)
- [Audiokinetic Wwise Documentation](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/)

## Extracting Audio
Use BNK explorer in the BNK Tool to open the BNK file you want to edit. It shows the hierarchical structure of the BNK. You can extract or inject sounds.
Event names are stored as hashes in the .bnk files, but we have built name tables to resolve a good amount of events back to their original name.

## Creating .wem Files
When editing audio files you must first install WWise. The files used by the game are .wem format which can be created from .wav files using WWise software.

Once you have a .wav file you want to convert to .wem, follow this video tutorial:
